- ChaCha20
- AES-RSA Hybrid Algorithm
- Serpent-RSA Hybrid Algorithm
- Twofish-RSA Hybrid Algorithm
- ThreeFish-RSA Hybrid Algorithm
- Camellia-RSA Hybrid Algorithm
- ChaCha20-RSA Hybrid Algorithm

You can set RSA Key Length (from 2048 to 16384) (it dont include 3072)

You can also set Symmetric Algorithm Key Size
